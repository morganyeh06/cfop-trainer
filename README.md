## The CFOP Method for Solving Rubik's Cubes
The CFOP method is the most common speedsolving method for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube, consisting of 4 steps: Cross, F2L, OLL, and PLL. The final steps are the most algorithm-intensive, with 78 algorithms needed to solve every last layer case. 

### OLL
OLL (short for Orientation of the Last Layer) is the penultimate step in the CFOP method which involves orienting the last layer pieces. There are 57 algorithms in total, but a variation known as 2-Look OLL exists which splits it up into two steps. 2-Look OLL first uses one algorithm to orient the edges, then another to orient the corners, which significantly decreases the number of algorithms that are needed.

### PLL
PLL (short for Permutation of the Last Layer) is the final step in the CFOP method which involves solving the remaining last layer pieces. There are 21 algorithms in total, but a variation known as 2-Look PLL exists which splits it up into two steps. 2-Look PLL first uses one algorithm to solve the corners, then another to solve the edges, which significantly decreases the number of algorithms that are needed.
